## Falah-fe Repository

Welcome to the Falah-fe repository! This project combines various frontends using module federation to create a cohesive and modular experience. Below is a detailed overview of how the repository works and its core features.

üõ† How It Works
	‚Ä¢	Module Federation
All frontends are combined using module federation to allow seamless integration.
	‚Ä¢	Each module can be developed and run independently.
	‚Ä¢	Run all frontends using:

npx lerna run dev


	‚Ä¢	Central Host Folder
	‚Ä¢	The main host folder acts as the central router for the application.
	‚Ä¢	This is where all modules are brought together and served as a single application.

üéØ Project Goals

We aim to build a multi-functional application with the following features:
	‚Ä¢	Events Application (Meet - Commit)
	‚Ä¢	Audio Player (Audio - Transmition)
	‚Ä¢	Includes a Quran player.
	‚Ä¢	Book Reader (Iqra - Primer)
	‚Ä¢	Forms

üóÇ Application Modules

Here are the planned application pages and their purposes:
	‚Ä¢	Homepage
	‚Ä¢	/ - Pocket (General Homepage)
	‚Ä¢	/2 - Salient (For mosque staff)
	‚Ä¢	Reader
	‚Ä¢	/Iqra - Primer (Book Reader)
	‚Ä¢	Audio Player
	‚Ä¢	/Audio - Transmition (Audio Player for Quran and more)
	‚Ä¢	Events
	‚Ä¢	/Meet - Commit (Events Management)
	‚Ä¢	Organisations Spotlight
	‚Ä¢	/Spotlight - Spotlight (For showcasing organisations)

üöÄ How to Get Started
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/falah-fe.git


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Run the development environment:

npx lerna run dev


	4.	Navigate to the central host folder to view the application.

üìù Contribution Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Use the module federation pattern for integrating new modules.
	‚Ä¢	Follow naming conventions for all new modules and pages.
	‚Ä¢	Test thoroughly before pushing to the central host.

Happy coding! ‚ú®
